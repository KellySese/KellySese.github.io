**Season 1 summary**

The story of Attack on Titan develops in a world where humans are an endangered species. For more than a hundred years, they have lived in fear of the Titans, a mysterious and violent race of human-like giants that wander outside the walls and that look for people to devour. At this point, there is not any information about what these creatures are or where they came from. So in order to protect the few human populations from the attacks of Titans, three layers of sky-high stone walls were constructed around the cities. Life inside the walls is peaceful and quiet enough, but the protagonist of the series, Eren Jaeger, wants to live adventures and to feel the freedom afforded to the Survey Corps, special warriors that fight against the Titans beyond the walls.

Eren Jaeger lives in Shiganshina, along with Armin Arlert, his best friend, and Mikasa Ackerman, his adopted sister that his family recently took in. Together, they live a relatively peaceful life until the day Titans burst into their city with the help of an enormous Titan that breaks the first wall of the city, Wall Maria. Among the violence and the confusion, Eren is the witness of how his mother is brutally eaten by a Titan during the attack. Full of anger and pain, the young boy swears revenge on the titans.

In despair, poverty and orphanhood, Eren, Armin and Mikasa decide to join the army and fight for the humans. During the five years training, Eren is the most passionate and aggressive soldier, while Armin becomes a great strategist, and Mikasa, the strongest and greatest cadet in the program. Along with other trainees, they enter the 104th Training Division, they graduate and start taking on several roles to prepare themselves for the future attack of another Titan.
However, shortly after their graduation, the Titans, led again by the Colossal Titan, come back to launch another offensive attack.

At the very start of the battle, and in a desperate attempt to save the life of Armin, Eren is dismembered and eaten by a Titan. But suddenly, when he is in his final moments, he realises that he can actually become a Titan himself by shedding his own blood in a moment of rage. Eren takes the chance to use his Titan powers to kill other Titans and help the other cadets to fight against them, before turning back into his human form. Although the great confusion that this event causes, he manages to survive the army’s interrogations and he offers his power as a tool for the human’s good.

Later in the story, the 104th Training Division members discover that Annie Leonhart, a young cadet of the team, can also turn into Titan and ended up trying to attack people using her power.

This first season ends with a big uncertainty. It became impossible to ignore the fact that humans can transform into Titans and that there are infiltrators in the army that are against humans. The final shot of the season shows a part of the wall that is crumbling away and reveals the face of a Titan inside the wall.
